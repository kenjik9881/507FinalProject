Include a clear README.md document
o The README should explain/include:
§ Everything a user needs to know about how to use the code included (e.g.
§ what precisely to type at a command prompt to run the code,
§ what name of database they must create for the code to work,
§ that they should pip install everything to requirements.txt,
§ what version of Python the project expects (e.g. Python 3),
§ if they need to fill in their own key and secret in a sample
secret_data.py file in order to run the code, and what URLs they
should go to to find the right key and secret…any information they
might need)
§ Basically what happens when the code runs (e.g. what classes are defined or
what a couple major functions’ input / output will be, what database tables
are created and used…)
§ What the user should expect after the code runs (what should they see, what
do any numbers they see represent, what will get created at the end — a
file? a chart? — and how they can view it, etc)
§ Links to any resources used (e.g. client libraries, API documentation) and
citations of any code borrowed from elsewhere
§ Also include in the readme a list of everyone with whom you worked on any
of the project or talked to about it in depth. Doing that is OK: sourcing help
from others is great! But no two projects should be alike — this should
be your own work.
o The README should be clearly organized and written in an outline format (not a
paragraph format like an essay)
